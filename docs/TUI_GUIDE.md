# FSS-Mini-RAG Text User Interface Guide

## Overview

The TUI (Text User Interface) provides a beginner-friendly, menu-driven way to use FSS-Mini-RAG without memorizing command-line syntax. It's designed with a "learn by doing" approach - you use the friendly interface while seeing the CLI commands, naturally building confidence to use the command line directly.

## Quick Start

```bash
./rag-tui
```

That's it! The TUI will guide you through everything.

## Interface Design Philosophy

### Learn by Doing
- **No reading required** - Jump in and start using it
- **CLI commands shown** - See equivalent commands as you work
- **Progressive disclosure** - Basic actions upfront, advanced options available
- **Natural transition** - Build confidence to try CLI commands

### User Flow
1. **Select Project** ‚Üí Choose directory to search
2. **Index Project** ‚Üí Process files for search
3. **Search Content** ‚Üí Find what you need quickly
4. **Explore Project** ‚Üí Interactive AI-powered discovery (NEW!)
5. **Configure System** ‚Üí Customize search behavior

## Main Menu Options

### 1. Select Project Directory

- **Use current directory** - Index where you are now  
- **Browse recent projects** - Pick from previously indexed projects

**What You Learn**:
- Project paths and directory navigation
- How RAG works with specific directories
- CLI equivalent: All commands need a project path

**CLI Commands Shown**:
```bash
# You'll see these patterns throughout
./rag-mini <command> /path/to/your/project
```

### 2. Index Project for Search

**Purpose**: Process files to make them searchable

**What Happens**:
- Scans all files in project directory
- Breaks text into searchable chunks
- Creates embeddings (AI numerical representations)
- Stores in local database (`.mini-rag/` folder)

**Interactive Elements**:
- **Force re-index option** - Completely rebuild if needed
- **Progress feedback** - See files being processed
- **Results summary** - Files processed, chunks created, timing

```

### 3. Search Project

**Purpose**: Find code using natural language queries

**Interactive Process**:
1. **Enter search query** - Natural language or keywords
2. **Set result limit** - How many matches to show (1-20)
3. **View results** - See full content, not just snippets

**Result Display**:
- **File path** - Relative to project root
- **Relevance score** - How closely it matches your query
- **Line numbers** - Exact location in file

2. **Existing Project**: Check status ‚Üí Search ‚Üí Re-index if outdated
3. **Multiple Projects**: Use recent projects browser for quick switching

### Search Strategies

**Concept Searches**:
- "user authentication" ‚Üí finds login, auth, sessions
- "database connection" ‚Üí finds DB code, connection pools, queries
- "error handling" ‚Üí finds try/catch, error classes, logging

**Specific Code Searches**:
- "class UserManager" ‚Üí finds class definitions
- "function authenticate()" ‚Üí finds specific functions
- "config settings" ‚Üí finds configuration code

**Pattern Searches**:
- "validation logic" ‚Üí finds input validation across files
- "API endpoints" ‚Üí finds route definitions and handlers
- "test cases" ‚Üí finds unit tests and test data

### Configuration Optimization

**Small Projects** (< 100 files):
- Default settings work well
- Consider smaller chunk sizes for very granular search

**Large Projects** (> 1000 files):
- Exclude build directories and dependencies
- Increase chunk sizes for broader context
- Use semantic chunking for code-heavy projects

**Mixed Content Projects**:
- Balance chunk sizes for code vs documentation
- Configure file patterns to include/exclude specific types
- Use appropriate embedding methods for content type

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Project not indexed"**:
- Use "Index project for search" from main menu
- Check if project path is correct
- Look for permission issues

**"No results found"**:
- Try broader search terms
- Check project is actually indexed
- Verify files contain expected content

**"Search results poor quality"**:
- Check embedding system status
- Consider re-indexing with --force
- Review configuration for project type

**"System seems slow"**:
- Check if Ollama is running (best performance)
- Consider ML fallback installation
- Review project size and exclude patterns
