## Problem Statement

Currently, FSS-Mini-RAG uses Ollama's default context window settings, which severely limits performance:

- **Default 2048 tokens** is inadequate for RAG applications
- Users can't configure context window for their hardware/use case
- No guidance on optimal context sizes for different models
- Inconsistent context handling across the codebase
- New users don't understand context window importance

## Impact on User Experience

**With 2048 token context window:**
- Only 1-2 responses possible before context truncation
- Thinking tokens consume significant context space
- Poor performance with larger document chunks
- Frustrated users who don't understand why responses degrade

**With proper context configuration:**
- 5-15+ responses in exploration mode
- Support for advanced use cases (15+ results, 4000+ character chunks)
- Better coding assistance and analysis
- Professional-grade RAG experience

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Model Configuration Menu
Added context window selection alongside model selection with:
- **Development**: 8K tokens (fast, good for most cases)
- **Production**: 16K tokens (balanced performance)  
- **Advanced**: 32K+ tokens (heavy development work)

### 2. Educational Content
Helps users understand:
- Why context window size matters for RAG
- Hardware implications of larger contexts
- Optimal settings for their use case
- Model-specific context capabilities

### 3. Consistent Implementation
- Updated all Ollama API calls to use consistent context settings
- Ensured configuration applies across synthesis, expansion, and exploration
- Added validation for context sizes against model capabilities
- Provided clear error messages for invalid configurations

## Technical Implementation

Based on comprehensive research findings:

### Model Context Capabilities
- **qwen3:0.6b/1.7b**: 32K token maximum
- **qwen3:4b**: 131K token maximum (YaRN extended)

### Recommended Context Sizes
```yaml
# Conservative (fast, low memory)
num_ctx: 8192    # ~6MB memory, excellent for exploration

# Balanced (recommended for most users)  
num_ctx: 16384   # ~12MB memory, handles complex analysis

# Advanced (heavy development work)
num_ctx: 32768   # ~24MB memory, supports large codebases
```

### Configuration Integration
- Added context window selection to TUI configuration menu
- Updated config.yaml schema with context parameters
- Implemented validation for model-specific limits
- Provided migration for existing configurations

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Longer conversation sessions
   - Better analysis quality
   - Clear performance expectations

2. **Professional RAG Capability**
   - Support for enterprise-scale projects
   - Handles large codebases effectively
   - Enables advanced use cases

3. **Educational Value**
   - Users learn about context windows
   - Better understanding of RAG performance
   - Informed decision making

## Files Changed

- `mini_rag/config.py`: Added context window configuration parameters
- `mini_rag/llm_synthesizer.py`: Dynamic context sizing with model awareness
- `mini_rag/explorer.py`: Consistent context application
- `rag-tui.py`: Enhanced configuration menu with context selection
- `PR_DRAFT.md`: Documentation of implementation approach

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test context configuration menu with different models
2. Verify context limits are enforced correctly
3. Test conversation length with different context sizes
4. Validate memory usage estimates
5. Test advanced use cases (15+ results, large chunks)
