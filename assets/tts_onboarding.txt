Welcome to FSS Mini RAG. This app makes your files searchable by meaning, not just keywords. On first launch, you’ll see three simple choices. Lite mode is the smallest download. It works great for search on any computer and is ready in minutes. Full offline mode adds a small local AI model so you can ask deeper questions without any internet. This is a larger download, but once it’s installed you’re fully offline. If you prefer cloud quality with a tiny download, choose the API option and paste your key from a provider like OpenAI. After you pick a mode, choose a folder, and click Index. That builds a private, local index on your machine. Then, ask a question like “Show me the authentication flow” or “Where do we write to the database?” You’ll get results with paths and line numbers, and you can ask follow-ups in Explore mode to get explanations with sources. Everything stays on your device unless you opt into a cloud provider. If you’re new, try the Demo button first to see it in action in under a minute. FSS Mini RAG—search smarter, learn faster, and stay in control of your data.
