# Icon Placeholder

The current `icon.svg` is a simple placeholder. Here's the design concept:

🔍 **Search magnifying glass** - Core search functionality  
📄 **Code brackets** - Code-focused system  
🧠 **Neural network dots** - AI/embedding intelligence  
📝 **Text lines** - Document processing  

## Design Ideas for Final Icon

- **Colors**: Blue (#1976d2) for trust/tech, Green (#4caf50) for code, Orange (#ff9800) for AI
- **Elements**: Search + Code + AI/Brain + Simplicity
- **Style**: Clean, modern, friendly (not intimidating)
- **Size**: Works well at 32x32 and 128x128

## Suggested Improvements

1. More polished magnifying glass with reflection
2. Cleaner code bracket styling  
3. More sophisticated neural network representation
4. Perhaps a small "mini" indicator to emphasize lightweight nature
5. Consider a folder or document icon to represent project indexing

The current SVG provides the basic structure and can be refined into a professional icon.
